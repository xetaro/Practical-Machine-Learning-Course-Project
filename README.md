# Practical-Machine-Learning-Course-Project
## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively.

These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Intended results

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. 

We may use any of the other variables to predict with. We should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. 

We will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

### 1.Peer Review Portion

The submission for the Peer Review portion should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing this analysis.
The text should be of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if  a repo submitted with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online. 


### 2.Course Project Prediction Quiz Portion

Apply the machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above and submit your predictions in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.


## Reproducibility

Due to security concerns with the exchange of R code, your code will not be run during the evaluation by your classmates. Please be sure that if they download the repo, they will be able to view the compiled HTML version of your analysis.
